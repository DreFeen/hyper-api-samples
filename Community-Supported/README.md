# Community Supported Samples
[![Community Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Community%20Supported-457387.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

The community samples focus on individual use cases and are Python-only. They have been written by members of the Tableau development team but recieve the level of 'Community Supported' as they may not be maintained in newer releases. Each of the samples has been manually tested and reviewed before publishing and will still be open to pull requests and issues.
