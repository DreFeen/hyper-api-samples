# Community Supported Samples
[![Community Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Community%20Supported-457387.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

The community samples are more use case specific and likely available in one language. They have been written by members of the Tableau development team but recieve the level of 'Community Supported' as they may not be maintained in newer releases. Each of the samples has been manually tested and reviewed before publishing and will still be open to pull requests and issues.

## What samples are available?
- __defragment_data_of_existing_hyper_file__
  - An example of how you can optimize the file storage of an existing `.hyper` file by copying all of the tables and data into a new file. This reduces file fragmentation.
- __publish_multi-table-hyper__
  - Demonstrates the full end-to-end workflow of how to create a multi-table `.hyper` file, place the extract into a `.tdsx`, and publish to Online/Server.
- __s3-to-hyper__
  - Creates a `.hyper` file from a wildcard union on text files held in an AWS S3 bucket. The extract is then placed in a `.tdsx` file and publishes to Online/Server.
