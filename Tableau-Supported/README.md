# Officially Supported Samples
[![Tableau Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Tableau%20Supported-53bd92.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

Each of these samples is officially supported, maintained, and tested by our developer team. They are available in each of the supported languages of the Hyper API and may be updated with every new release.

<br  />

## What do these samples do?
There are currently eight samples that are available in each language supported:

* __create_hyper_file_from_csv__
  * Demonstrates how you can use the Hyper SQL COPY command to quickly populate a table in the .hyper file from the contents of a comma-separated value (CSV) file. This technique is the fastest way to bring data into an extract, as Hyper is reading data directly from the CSV file.

* __delete_data_from_existing_hyper_file__
  * Demonstrates how you can use the Hyper SQL DELETE command to remove data from a table in the .hyper file.

* __insert_data_into_multiple_tables__
  * This example shows how you can create and insert data into a .hyper file that contains multiple tables. Uses the Inserter class to add data to the tables and a Hyper SQL query to report the number of rows in the tables.

* __insert_data_into_single_table__
  * Demonstrates how you to add data to a single table named Extract that uses the Extract schema. Uses the Inserter class to add data to the table and a Hyper SQL query to report the number of rows in the table.

* __read_and_print_data_from_existing_hyper_file__
  * Demonstrates how to read data from an existing .hyper file and print the output to the console.

* __update_data_in_existing_hyper_file__
  * This example demonstrates how you can use the Hyper SQL UPDATE command to change values in a .hyper file.

* __insert_spatial_data_to_a_hyper_file__
  * This example demonstrates how to insert spatial data (WKT) to a .hyper file

* __insert_data_using_expressions__
  * This example shows how you can use SQL expressions in Hyper API Inserter to transform or compute data on the fly during data insertion
